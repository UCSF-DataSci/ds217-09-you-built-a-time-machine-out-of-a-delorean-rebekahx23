Timezone Report

- What timezone was your original data in?
The original data did not have timezone information. It only had datetime values like month, year, and day.

- How did you localize the data?
I localized the data to by using the tz_localize('UTC') method in pandas to localize the dates to UTC time.

- What timezone did you convert to?
I converted the timezone to 'US/Eastern' using the tz_convert('US/Eastern') method.

- What issues did you encounter with DST? (Note: Using UTC avoids DST ambiguity)
I did not encounter any issues with DST because I stored the data in UTC, which does not observe daylight saving time. 
Using UTC avoids the DST ambiguity.

- Include at least one example showing a datetime before and after conversion
Sample timestamp of '2023-03-12 10:00:00' in UTC will be converted to '2023-03-12 05:00:00-05:00' in US/Eastern timezone before the day light savings change, and to '2023-03-12 06:00:00-04:00' after the day light savings change. 
This demonstrates how the 1 hour shift due to DST is handled.

- Explain why UTC is recommended as the base timezone for storing temporal data
UTC is recommended as the base timezone for storing temporal data because it provides a consistent reference point, making it easier to manage and analyze across different regions.
